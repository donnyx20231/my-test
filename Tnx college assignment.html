    <p>We are a small consultancy that has specialized in object-oriented programming. We are not now taking on new
        clients as our principals are busy doing other things. We have closed our office on SW 40th Avenue. We are happy
        to correspond by email at the contact address below. We continue to operate this site and are happy to provide its
        services to the community for the foreseeable future.
    </p>
        <br>
    <p>We have a sampling of papers, talks and position statements we've written over the years and some new pages
        composed just for the web.
